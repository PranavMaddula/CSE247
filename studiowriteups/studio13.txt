Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:
F: 1
G: 1
B: 2
D: 2
A: 3
C: 3


Question A2:
All edges but B->D, C->A, and A->B

Question A3:
A:0,7
B:1,6
C:3,3
D:5,5

Question B1:
No, there is no ordering as there are multiple cyclic portions to the graph presented

Question B2:
As V finishes first, and V is a leaf node of U, the search can then traverse up the tree to complete U. 

Question B3:
V finishes before U, as V must be traversed before U is finished

Question B4:
If V is finished before U is even started, V is finished before U

Question B5:
No, as V is a leaf of U, V cannot be in progress with U being traversed

Question B6:
As based on the conditions above, we know that V must be travered before U

Question C1:
ABECDF

Question C2:
ACDBEF
ABCEDF
ABECDF

Question C3:


Question C4:
A leaf vertex, and for our example that will be vertex F

Question C5:
Finishing time will be faster than that of any other element, as it will be done in 1 time.

Question C6:
Start it at the last element, and move it back one element each time
Start at Vn and then reexecute at Vn-1 ... untill out of nodes

Question C7:
F,E,B,D,C,A -> A,B,E,C,D,A

Question D1:
This is a valid topological order as if there is no directed edge between a and b, b cannot come before a
If there is no edge that exists from Vi to Vi+1, then there could be a path between the two, however as there are no elements between Vi and Vi+1, there cannot be an inderect path between the two.

Question D2:
If there is a direct path that has a length of V-1 edges, it must have a unique topological edges as there is no other or more effecent way to connect the nodes together

Question D3:

Done!
