Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:

- ProbA		n-1

- ProbB		n*(n-1)/2

- ProbC		n*(n+1)/2

- ProbD		(n(n+1)*(2n+1))/6

- ProbE		((n(n+1)*(2n+1))/6) - n

Question B1:

1.  c = 1          n0 = 1
2.  c = 1          n0 = 1
3.  c = 1          n0 = 1 

Question C1:

1.	5000 = O(n^2),	 c = 50 and n0 = 10
2.	an+b = O(n),     c = 1, n0 = 1 if a&b>0

Question D1:

1. Not theta, as the left is n^2 and the right is a constant. Thus, the left of function 1 is not theta of the right
2. Theta, as the right side of is n, and the largest power on the left side is n as well. Thus, the left of function 2 is theta of the right


Question E1: 
n^1.5 grows faster than nlog(n)
n^1000 grows faster than 1.01^n
nlog2(n) grows faster than nlog3(n)

Question E2:
If you use the value 4 for c, you find that O(n) is true. This is because every time we reach the value 2^(n+1)
we need to copy 2^n and everything before that segment, effectively copying 2(2^(n+1)), which ends up being
4n.
